I rebased a582d7b025fe545889390a1de6b8d194733a1c25 on top of the latest master branch (4d2227c), together with the latest Irrlicht master branch (minetest/irrlicht@85081d6).

In my tests, this PR didn't work as expected. Here's a video:

1. When I tried to use the "while drag&dropping, tap the screen with another finger to put a single item into the hovered slot" feature, the entire stack was put into the hovered slot, not just a single item.

   The feature only worked correctly if the first slot I tried to put an item into was the source slot, or no slot at all (e.g. a border between two slots).

2. Since #13146, you can left-drag to distribute an itemstack evenly across multiple slots. If you tap the screen with another finger during this operation, the item counts get confused. The second tap should probably be ignored in this case, as it was before this PR.
